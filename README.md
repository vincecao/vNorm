###[Vincec Normalize CSS](https://vcec.gitlab.io/blog/2018/07/01/vnormalize-css/index.html) - vnorm.css

For make life easier, I tweaked flex into a small normalize css file. Now with [vnorm.css](https://gitlab.com/vcec/vnrom), we can make layout much quickly, all following class default will add the setting of _Vertically Center_ to the child elements, and by different classes performing as:
- `expand`(Expand the current element across relatively)
- `hori`(Horizontal Layout towards the child elements)
- `vert`(Vertical Layout towards the child elements)
- `center`(Horizontal Center towards the child elements)
- `bwt`(Add a flex space between the child elements)
- `end`(Make the child elements flex from end)

A small [demo](https://codepen.io/vvvvvincecccc/pen/WavZaM) for how it works
